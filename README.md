> Honey Mart Server acts as the backend app for the [Honey Mart Client](https://github.com/TheChance101/Honey-Mart-Android-Client) shopping application, serving as the backend infrastructure that powers the entire shopping experience. This server application is implemented using Ktor, a lightweight yet powerful Kotlin framework for building asynchronous servers and clients, and it relies on PostgreSQL as the database to store and manage the app's data.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Project

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone the project repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/honey-mart-server.git
   cd honey-mart-server
### Set Up the Database

1.  **Create a Database**:
    
    -   Open a terminal or command prompt and log in to PostgreSQL using the `psql` command or pgAdmin:
`psql -U postgres`
	-   Replace `postgres` with your PostgreSQL username if different.
	-   Create a new database (replace `honey_mart_db` with your preferred name):
    `CREATE DATABASE honey_mart_db;`
### Configure IntelliJ IDEA

1.  In IntelliJ IDEA, configure the database connection using the following details:
    
    -   Host: `localhost` (or your PostgreSQL server's hostname/IP)
    -   Port: `5432` (or your PostgreSQL server's port)
    -   Database: `honey_mart_db` (or your database name)
    -   User: Your PostgreSQL username
    -   Password: Your PostgreSQL password (if set)
 2. Configure Environment Variables to contain the following key-value pairs:
   	 - adminEmail = Your admin email
	 - adminFullName = Your admin full name
	 - adminPassword = Your admin password
	 - databaseName = `honey_mart_db` (or your database name)
	 - databasePassword = Your PostgreSQL password (if set)
	 - databaseUsername = Your PostgreSQL username
	 - firebase_key = Firebase admin SDK private key
	 - HONEY_JWT_SECRET = JWT for the Token
	 - honey_secret_api_key = any Api key you want
	 - host = `localhost` (or your PostgreSQL server's hostname/IP)
	 - port = `5432` (or your PostgreSQL server's port)
    
**Build and Run the Docker Container**:
-   Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located).
-   Build a Docker image for your server:
    
    `docker build -t honey-mart-server .`
1.  Your server is now running in a Docker container and accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
